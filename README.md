# Ais Reporter Addon

A custom addon for [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) that reads data from a serial port and rebroadcasts it over UDP. It was written to provide a convenient way to provide data to an AIS aggregator like [Marine Traffic](https://marinetraffic.com) from a locally connected AIS receiver.
